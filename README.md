✅ Data Cleaning : In this step includes removing inconsistencies in data, errors, and duplicates and ensuring that the data with which I worked is accurate and reliable for further analysis.

✅ Data Processing : Creating some new columns that involved organizing, sorting, and filtering the data to extract meaningful insights.

✅ Data Analysis : Used various statistical methods to get valuable insights from the data.

✅ Data Visualization: Used Excel as a visualization tool. With the help of this, I have created attractive charts, graphs, and interactive visuals to present the data in an easy way.

✅ Dashboard Making : Dashboard became interactive and dynamic by creating a filter panel using timeline and slicer as already created in pivot table. Dashboard also has link which lead to the dashboard, my email, client website(if requested) and to the Data Analysis Sheet directly and vice versa
